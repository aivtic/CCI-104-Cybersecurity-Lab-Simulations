## Step-by-Step Setup for a Vulnerable WordPress Installation

### Step 1: Download the Vulnerable WordPress Version

1. **Navigate to the web server directory**:
   ```bash
   cd /var/www/html
   ```

2. **Download a vulnerable version of WordPress**:
   - For the purpose of this lab, we will download **WordPress 4.7.5**, which has a known **Rest API vulnerability** and others.
   - You can find older versions on the official WordPress release archives: [WordPress Release Archive](https://wordpress.org/download/releases/).

   ```bash
   sudo wget https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.7.5.tar.gz
   ```

3. **Extract the downloaded archive**:
   ```bash
   sudo tar -xvzf wordpress-4.7.5.tar.gz
   ```

4. **Rename the extracted directory** (for clarity):
   ```bash
   sudo mv wordpress wp-vulnerable
   ```

5. **Set proper permissions**:
   ```bash
   sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/wp-vulnerable
   sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/wp-vulnerable
   ```

### Step 2: Create and Configure MySQL Database

1. **Log into MySQL**:
   ```bash
   sudo mysql -u root -p
   ```

2. **Create a new database for WordPress**:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE wordpress_vulnerable;
   ```

3. **Create a user for WordPress**:
   ```sql
   CREATE USER 'wp_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'wp_password';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wordpress_vulnerable.* TO 'wp_user'@'localhost';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   ```

4. **Exit MySQL**:
   ```sql
   EXIT;
   ```

---

### Step 3: Configure WordPress

1. **Navigate to the WordPress directory**:
   ```bash
   cd /var/www/html/wp-vulnerable
   ```

2. **Rename the configuration sample file**:
   ```bash
   sudo mv wp-config-sample.php wp-config.php
   ```

3. **Edit the wp-config.php file** to configure the database connection:
   ```bash
   sudo nano wp-config.php
   ```

4. **Update the database details** in `wp-config.php`:
   ```php
   define( 'DB_NAME', 'wordpress_vulnerable' );
   define( 'DB_USER', 'wp_user' );
   define( 'DB_PASSWORD', 'wp_password' );
   define( 'DB_HOST', 'localhost' );
   ```

5. **Save and exit** the file editor (CTRL+X, Y, Enter).

---

### Step 4: Install WordPress

1. Open your browser and go to:
   ```
   http://localhost/wp-vulnerable
   ```

2. Follow the **WordPress installation wizard**:
   - Set up your **site name**, **admin username**, **password**, and **email**.
   - Complete the installation and log into the WordPress admin dashboard.

---

### Step 5: Install Vulnerable Plugins and Themes

To simulate real-world vulnerabilities, weâ€™ll install **known vulnerable plugins** that work with WordPress 4.7.x.

1. **Install Vulnerable Plugins**:
   - **RevSlider** (vulnerable to remote code execution).
   - **WP-File-Manager** (vulnerable to unauthorized file access).
   - **WordPress Mobile Pack** (vulnerable to XSS attacks).
   
   **Installation Method**:
   - Download the vulnerable plugins from a trusted GitHub repository or known source.
   - Upload them to `/wp-content/plugins/`.
   - Activate the plugins via the WordPress Admin Panel under **Plugins > Installed Plugins**.

2. **Install Vulnerable Themes**:
   - You can use older versions of WordPress themes known to have vulnerabilities. For example, themes like **Twenty Seventeen** can be vulnerable in older versions.
   - Download vulnerable themes from GitHub or repositories, then upload them to `/wp-content/themes/`.
   - Activate the theme via the WordPress Admin Panel under **Appearance > Themes**.

### Step 6: Explore Common Vulnerabilities in WordPress

The following are known vulnerabilities found in older versions like 4.7.x:

1. **SQL Injection**:
   - Check input fields like **search**, **login**, or **comment** sections for SQL injection vulnerabilities.
   - Use **SQLMap** or manual testing for exploiting SQLi.
   - Example payload: `' OR 1=1 --`.

2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**:
   - Test comment forms, post titles, and other input areas for reflected XSS.
   - Example payload: `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`.

3. **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**:
   - **RevSlider** plugin in WordPress 4.7.x has a **Remote Code Execution (RCE)** vulnerability.
   - Try uploading a **PHP shell** or a malicious file through this plugin to gain code execution on the server.

4. **Local File Inclusion (LFI)**:
   - Test if plugins or themes are vulnerable to LFI, which can include files like `/etc/passwd`.
   - Example payload: `file.php?include=../../../../etc/passwd`.

5. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**:
   - Exploit CSRF vulnerabilities by creating malicious links that can change user settings or post content without the user's consent.
   
6. **Sensitive Data Exposure**:
   - Check if sensitive information like passwords or API keys is exposed in plaintext.
   - Use tools like **Burp Suite** or **Wireshark** to monitor unencrypted traffic.

---

### Step 7: Exploit Vulnerabilities

Here are some ways to exploit vulnerabilities in this setup:

1. **SQL Injection**:
   - Use **SQLMap** or manual payloads to test SQL injection.
   - Example payload: `' OR 1=1 --`.

2. **XSS**:
   - Inject **JavaScript** in comment forms, post titles, or any input field.
   - Example payload: `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`.

3. **RCE (Remote Code Execution)**:
   - Upload a malicious **PHP file** through plugins like **RevSlider**.
   - Execute the PHP file using a browser: `evil.php?cmd=ls`.

4. **LFI (Local File Inclusion)**:
   - Use **LFI** to read sensitive system files.
   - Example payload: `file.php?include=../../../../etc/passwd`.

5. **Brute Force**:
   - Use **Hydra** or **Burp Suite** to attempt **brute-forcing** the admin login.
   - WordPress default usernames (`admin`) are common targets.

---

### Step 8: Secure the WordPress Installation

After exploiting the vulnerabilities, secure the WordPress installation by:

1. **Updating WordPress and Plugins**:
   - Ensure WordPress is updated to the latest version.
   - Regularly update plugins and themes.

2. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**:
   - Install the **Two-Factor Authentication** plugin to secure admin login.

3. **Use Strong Passwords**:
   - Ensure users use **strong, complex passwords** for all accounts.

4. **Limit Login Attempts**:
   - Use a plugin like **Limit Login Attempts** to prevent brute force attacks.

5. **Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF)**:
   - Install plugins like **Wordfence** or **iThemes Security** to add a firewall and other security measures.

6. **Remove Unnecessary Plugins/Themes**:
   - Delete any unused plugins and themes to reduce the attack surface.

7. **Use HTTPS**:
   - Set up an SSL certificate to encrypt the communication between the client and the server.
